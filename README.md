# Python-Regex-Functions
A Short Notes on Python Regex Functions, with examples.

The main aim of this repo, is to collect all functions in one place with examples. we can obseve patterns between functions when we list them in speadsheet format.

For Example, 

	* Most of the functions take pattern and string as inputs with flags as optional input.
        * There are two objects that get returned generally  >> Pattern Object & Match Object.
